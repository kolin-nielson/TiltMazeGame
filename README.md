## Overview
The Tilt Maze challenges players to tilt their phone to roll a ball from the start to the green goal. Mazes grow more complex with static walls, dynamic laser gates, and collectible coins. Earn coins to unlock fun skins and strive for the highest score!

## Features
- **Intuitive Tilt Controls**: Uses device accelerometer for natural motion
- **Procedural Mazes**: Every level is generated via depth-first search
- **Laser Gates**: Timed obstacles that cycle on/off for extra challenge
- **Coin Collectibles**: Persistent currency to unlock over a dozen ball skins
- **Themes & Settings**: Light/dark mode, sensitivity control, and haptics toggle
- **Advanced Animations**: Smooth transitions powered by Reanimated
- **Realistic Physics**: Collisions and ball movement via Matter.js
- **High Score Tracking**: Progress saved locally with AsyncStorage

## Technologies
- **React Native** & **Expo** â€” Cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript** â€” Type safety and autocompletion
- **Redux Toolkit** â€” Streamlined state management
- **React Navigation** â€” Screen navigation and routing
- **React Native Paper** â€” Material Design UI components
- **React Native Reanimated** â€” High-performance animations
- **Matter.js** â€” 2D physics engine for realistic ball dynamics
- **@react-native-async-storage** â€” Persistent storage of settings & progress

## Material Design Implementation

The Tilt Maze implements Google's Material Design principles throughout the application to create a cohesive, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience. The implementation is built on React Native Paper, which provides Material Design components following the latest MD3 specification. The app features a comprehensive theming system with both light and dark modes that adhere to Material Design color principles, including primary, secondary, and tertiary color palettes with their container and on-color variants.

Key Material Design components used include Cards for game overlays and settings, Dialogs for confirmations, AppBar for navigation headers, and Surface components for creating proper elevation hierarchies. Custom components like buttons and setting items were developed following Material Design specifications for typography, spacing, and elevation. The app implements proper Material Design elevation with platform-specific shadows that create a sense of depth and hierarchy. Animations follow Material Design motion principles with appropriate easing curves and durations, creating smooth and meaningful transitions between states.

The integration extends to navigation as well, with Material Design themes adapted for React Navigation to ensure consistent styling across the entire application. This comprehensive approach to Material Design creates a premium feel while maintaining the playful aesthetic appropriate for a mobile game, demonstrating how Material Design principles can be effectively applied to create engaging interactive experiences.

## Architecture
- **Components**: Reusable UI modules in `src/components`
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks (gyroscope, physics) in `src/hooks`
- **Store (Redux)**: Slice-based state in `src/store/slices`
- **Screens**: App screens in `src/screens`
- **Utils**: Utility functions in `src/utils`
- **Config**: Constants & themes in `src/config/constants.ts`
